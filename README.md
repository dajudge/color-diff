# Color-diff
[![pipeline status](https://gitlab.com/dajudge/color-diff/badges/master/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/dajudge/color-diff/commits/master)

__Disclaimer__: This project aims to be a 1:1 port of Markus Ekholm's great
[color-diff](https://github.com/markusn/color-diff) library which is
written in Javascript.

Implements the CIEDE2000 color difference algorithm, conversion between RGB and
LAB color and mapping all colors in palette X to the closest color in palette Y
based on the CIEDE2000 difference.
